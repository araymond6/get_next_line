# get_next_line
Project for 42Quebec
The goal of this project is to make a function that, when called, will get you the first line of a file until the newline character. When it is called again, it will give you the second line and so on.

# Bonus
The bonus it to make the function work for multiple files at the same time, as it keeps tracks of the different file descriptors that are open.
